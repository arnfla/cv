## Projects

Studying at *Høgskulen på Vestlandet* and working in Marin IT AS has yielded extensive knowledge in the areas of System Architecture, System Administration and Operations. 

### Skype for business migration
`Summer 2020`
__DOF ASA/Austevoll Seafood AS/FMV AS/Marin IT AS__

__Project:__ As a part of the strategy to deliver services in the cloud and the aging Skype for business (SfB) environment an initiative to move from Skype for business on-premise to Skype for business Online was created. This was quickly expanded to move from SfB to Microsoft Teams. Project was therefore to move the users from the SfB servers on-premise to SfB Online and from there enable "Teams Only" mode. On success plans was also made to decomission the old on-premise infrastructure. 

__Result:__ All users on the on-premise servers was moved within a week. Servers are decomissioned and firewall openings removed. Very successful project.

__Role:__ Technical lead

__Technologies/Tools:__ Windows Powershell, Skype for business, Micorosft Teams, DNS


### Cisco Unified Call Manager upgrade
`Summer 2020`
__DOF ASA/Austevoll Seafood AS/Marin IT AS__

__Project:__ Replace the older Cusco Unified Call manager (CUCM) solution. As the project got working the head technical lead left the company and project was paused. Before handing it over to me the scope had grown and there were now requests for new features that was required before launch. We implemented softphone calling in Cisco Jabber, added new logic for phone queueing and increased security with regards to having services available from anywhere. Basic features implemented was new call managers (publishers and subscribers) globally, configuring phone gateways, creating call logic and routing.

__Result:__ New CUCM rolled out with new features such as softphone and hunt pilot queueing (helpdesk queue)

__Role:__ Technical resource working with external consultant and management in Marin IT.

__Technologies/Tools:__ Cisco UCM, Windows Active Directory, Cisco Webex


### Cisco Webex design and implementation
`Summer 2020`
__DOF ASA/Austevoll Seafood AS/Marin IT AS__

__Project:__ In 2019 the implementation of the Cisco Webex codecs was made and these were installed globally. As license renewal for Pexip was this summer we looked at what Cisco could offer with regards to video conferencing, audio bridging and cloud video interop (CVI). Cisco Webex was therefore rolled out to the major customers of Marin IT using the Cisco Webex codecs. Project was working in iterations as we were implementing features not supported by Cisco at the time (read. workarounds), and later having the released as features. Cisco Webex is fully integrated with Office 365/Azure for all organizations which provides calendar sync, user provisioning and authentication (MFA and Conditinal Access)

__Result:__ Currently there are 1200+ users onboarded and 20+ video systems ranging from systems for huddle rooms to large boardrooms.

__Role:__ Technical lead, Decision maker and Integrator.

__Technologies/Tools:__ Cisco Webex platform, Cisco Webex devices, Cisco Unified Call Manager (CUCM), Azure, Exchange Online


### Enabling Global Protect VPN solution
`Spring 2020`
__Marin IT AS__

__Project:__ Due to aging VPN solution (Pulse Secure) and already having Palo Altos in place we decided to implement Global Protect VPN. Project was initiated by Marin IT and with help from a consultant at DataEquipment AS we had the solution up and running within a day.
To have the most secure environment we enabled Singe Sign-On (SSO) with Azure to leverage the Multifactor authentication and conditional access policy benefits.

__Result:__ Project was completed and users were onboarded on a "need to have" basis as we wanted the users to use the Citrix Workspace solution instead.

### Assist scaling citrix solution
`Spring 2020`

My responsibilities was assiting with configuring the netscaler correctly and monitoring it afterwards. We also had to make a few changes as to how the environment was accessed, meaning spreading users out on multiple gateways both on-premise and in the cloud.

__Result:__ Project is still ongoing, but closed from the network side. The changes was made early on and adopted to fit the design, we now reap the benefits of having one workspace.

__Role:__ Network technician
